In this section, we demonstrate how we can use Eq. (\ref{eq:greedyUnified}) to solve Eqs. (\ref{eqn:cokriging_reformulate}) and (\ref{eqn:forecasting_reformulate}). In the cokriging problem, it is easy to see that with $\Y_{:,:,m} = H$ and $\V_{:,:,m} = \X_{\Omega, m}$ for $m = 1, \ldots, M$ the problems are equivalent. In the forecasting problem, $H$ is full rank and the mapping defined by  $\W \mapsto \tilde{\W}: \tilde{\W}_{:,:,m} = H\W_{:,:,m}$ for $m=1, \ldots, M$ preserves the tensor rank, i.e., $\mathrm{rank}(\W) = \mathrm{rank}(\tilde{\W})$. This suggests that we can solve Eq. (\ref{eqn:cokriging_reformulate}) as follows: first solve Eq. (\ref{eq:greedyUnified}) with $\Y_{:,:,m} = \mathbf{X}_{K+1:T, m}$ and $\V_{:,:,m} = \X_{:,:,m}$ and obtain its solution as $\tilde{\W}$; then compute $\W_{:,:,m} = H^{-1}\tilde{\W}_{:,:,m}$.
