The critical element in multivariate spatio-temporal analysis is an efficient way to incorporate the spatial temporal correlations  into the model and automatically capture the shared structures among variables, locations, and time. In this section, we present a unified low rank tensor learning framework that can perform various types of spatio-temporal analysis. We will use two important applications, i.e., cokriging and forecasting,  to motivate and describe the framework. %,  which not only captures the complex correlations in the data, but also is scalable.
