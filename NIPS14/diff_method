The critical element in multivariate spatio-temporal analysis is an efficient way to incorporate the spatial temporal correlations  into [31m[-modeling-][m[32m{+the model+}[m and automatically capture the shared structures [31m[-across-][m[32m{+among+}[m variables, locations, and time. In this section, we present a unified low rank tensor learning framework that can perform various types of spatio-temporal analysis. We will use two important applications, i.e., cokriging and forecasting,  to motivate and describe the framework. %,  which not only captures the complex correlations in the data, but also is scalable.
